    <div class = "parallax"><h1>Welcome to my blog</h1></div>

    <div class = "middle">

        <div class = "center">
            Good morning! For this weeks blog I decided to research the parallax effect. I remember you mentioning it in class a bit ago so I decided to look into it myself.
            It seemed like it would be a complicated effect, however it was actually quite simple. I think it looks really good and will certainly be implementing it into my 
            first project site. The one challenge I encountered was alligning the heading text, "Welcome to my blog" within the first parallax image. I didnt realize that it
            was possible to use flexbox within a parallax image, but alas you can, and I think it has a pretty cool result. This is a snippet from my css which formats the 
            parallax: 
        </div>

    </div>
    <div id = "snippet"><img src="snippet.PNG"></div>

    <div class = "middle">
        <div class = "center">
            As you can see it is super simple, theres really only 2 properties to set for the effect: background-image, and background-attachment. The other properties are for sizing
            and placement of other objects etc. to get the above and bellow effect there are actually 2 parallax items, one before this div and one below it. I followed W3schools <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_parallax.asp">how to parallax.</a>
