    <h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>

    <div class = "first">
        <p>This week we dove into the format of a web page. We learned that HTML provides the content, and CSS provides the format. We learned how to do things like </p>
        <p id = "font">This</p>
        <p> and</p>
        <p id = "color">This</p>
        <p>While we are beginning to learn the tools to style a webpage, I suspect I will have to do more research in order to learn what good design is like. I know nothing about how to layout a page, color theory, etc. Ant I suspect this first blog is going to be quite the eyesore. I took programming in highschool and the first thing we learned was HTML, that was 6 years ago. Time flies. In that class we never learned about CSS so we build exclusively ugly webpages. I'm glad we are diving into CSS so I can (once i learn what one looks like) make a half decent webpage. Enjoy this meme.</p>
