            Good morning! First of all I want to thank you for sticking through this most unfortunate semester and continuing to teach a rather valuable class. To be honest I haven't really been all to pleased with my overall education this semester, as I was someone who really benefitted from in person class.
             Throughout this pandemic and all of my online classes, I have continually reminded myself that just as much as I didn't sign up to take online classes, my professors didn't sign up to teach them. It is rather disheartening that my final semesters in college are being spent this way, and that I feel 
             like I am not getting as much out of some of my classes that I would in person. And I know I am not alone with this feeling, and it is just an unfortunate out of control situation that is impacting everybody. Here are some things I would do if I were teaching a class in this situation.
             <br>
             <br>
            First of all I really think synchronous classes are the way to go when class is online. The amount of student questions and banter with the professor is already lacking when the classes aren't face to face, but that is gone when the class is asynchronous. I do think the synchronous labs were nice,
            however one major issue I faced was that if a group member wasn't participating or hadn't watched the lectures, it was really difficult. I think a good middle ground would be tuesday lectures and thursday labs or something like that. I think Dr. Lam has mastered the art of online class, and his compilers course,
            which you are familliar with, has been the best course I've taken online, and is a good model for the lecture/lab structure. Another thing which could really benefit future courses is a canvas page. There were many occaisions where I simply forgot the blog post as it wasn't on my canvas calendar, which is the main 
            source of orgainization in my life. Now this is mostly on me, however it would have been nice. I do however think using slack was a great idea. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Overall I did enjoy the content of this course, and think the assignments were beneficial to our learning. Also I througholy enjoyed you as a professor, and think you are quite charming and funny. 
            Normally I like to shake my professors hands and thank them at the end of the semseter, however I think the chances of that are slim to none, as I am not in Harrisonburg, but again thank you very much 
            and I hope you have a long, prosperous, and enjoyable career at JMU, ISAT-CS is an enjoyable place to be when its full of students.
